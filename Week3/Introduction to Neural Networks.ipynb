In essense a Neural Network is in fact sets of *Logits* (Logical Units) that are stacked to form layers and multiple layers of the same to form a network of logits such that each logit in a layer has a set of weighted of inputs that are passed through a function to generate the output which will in turn be fed to a logit in the next layer."
